# HoriSEOn Homepage Refactor

![Final Product](images/final-screen-shot.png)

## The Project

The client requested that we take a look at their homepage to find some ways to improve the code's accessibility. After some quick examination, it was clear there were several ways the code was not only hampering accessibiltiy, but was probably slowing things down for them as well. I could see the following major problems:

- the website had no title;
- accessibility was being hampered by a lack of semantic HTML elements;
- none of the images had alt attributes;
- the CSS was, frankly, a mess, and was full of redundency, in my opinion.

Several other components of the code were not done to convention and/or my perceived best-practices, and some minor debugging was necessary.

### The Process

I refactored this code in phases, starting by renaming semantic elements in the HTML and translating any necessary changes to the CSS. In subsequent phases, I consolidated and reorganized styling to make it more readable, all the while making sure that site retained functionality. At times, I made some changes that led to errors that I spent some time figuring out how to fix, but thanks to some diligence and help from colleagues, I made it in the end.

## Installation

Simply navigate to the site URL: "https://torontow.github.io/MT-HoriSEOn-Acc.github.io/"

## Usage

The purpose of the refactoring was to improve accessibility. General usage of the site remains unchanged.

## Credits

-University of Toronto School of Continuing Studies Boot Camp instruction team, especially to Ed Apostol for introducing me to code validating software, without which I would have missed some errors that were not affecting appearance but would have affected accessibility
-Special thanks to fellow students Mike Tkachuk, Dazrin Tioseco and Omair Muhi for their contributions
